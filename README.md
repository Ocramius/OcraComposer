# OcraComposer

This module aims to provide (for now) simple autoloading 
for [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) based
[Zend Skeleton Application](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication)
installations.

# Usage

  1. Setup this module as a dependency in your module's or application's `composer.json`
     (the [packagist](http://packagist.org) package name is 
     [ocramius/OcraComposer](http://packagist.org/packages/ocramius/OcraComposer).
  2. Setup your `config/application.config.php` to load the `OcraComposer` module
  3. Add `vendor/ocramius` to your module paths in `config/application.config.php`
